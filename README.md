# Novel-Intramedullary-Nail-Design-To-Improve-Healing-Of-Spiral-Fractures
<p align="justify">
Various fracture fixation methods have been utilized to promote fracture healing, based on the type and location of the fracture. Intramedullary (IM) nails have been long used to treat spiral fractures located distal to the knee and ankle. Consequently, this analysis aims to propose a novel IM nail design for the treatment of spiral fractures based on a given case (33-year-old man), which aims to reduce stress shielding and avoid re-surgery.

The figure below illustrates the pull-out performance of bone screws in Sawbones, which is dependent on the varying foam densities of the bone models. The results indicate that under low tensile stresses, screw removal occurs for osteoporotic bone (7.5 pcf) compared to denser bone (20 pcf) which can withstand greater tensile forces. Given the case study scenario, the patient should have lower bone density compared to the average bone density of a 33-year-old male, however, the chances of a screw pull-out due to bone density are not the largest concern as the cortical bone layer in the patientâ€™s tibia provides the added strength. The IM nail will provide tibial fixation through the use of orthogonal (or angularly slanted) screws to penetrate the cortical bone layer. The figure shows that the bone models similar to cortical bone provided the highest mechanical performance.

Pull-out testing results of screws in five Sawbones of different foam densities and layers. The 7.5 pcf model represents osteoporotic cancellous bone, 20 pcf represents normal cancellous bone. The 2-3mm layer on some models represent the cortical bone layer. For 12.5 pcf and 20 pcf Sawbones, the 2mm layer is a short fibre composite layer. The 20 pcf + 3mm layer is a 40 pcf foam layer.
